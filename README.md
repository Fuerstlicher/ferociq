## Hey guys üëã

### üë§ About me

I'm Manu and I'm from Germany. I'm a Freelance Developer and I'm currently building a company called [OPZebra.
My network "OPZebra" consists of many small projects. For example, we programmed one of the first global chat bots for Discord.

If you are wondering why my personal account here is so empty, I mostly work on projects that are private.
I will publish the projects as soon as they are completely finished. 

I am currently working on several Discord bots and some web stuff.
