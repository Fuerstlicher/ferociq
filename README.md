## Hey guys üëã

I'm Manu a freelance developer and enthusiastic gamer from germany. Currently building a network called [OPZebra](https://www.opzebra.de/).
My network consists of many small projects. For example, we programmed one of the first global chatbots for Discord in 2019, but it is now offline. 

If you are wondering why my personal account here is so empty, I mostly work on projects that are private.
I will publish the projects as soon as they are completely finished.
