### üë§ About me

I'm Manu a freelance developer and enthusiastic gamer from germany. Currently building a network called [OPZebra](https://www.opzebra.de/).
My network consists of many small projects. For example, we programmed one of the first global chat bots for Discord.

I will publish the projects as soon as they are completely finished.
