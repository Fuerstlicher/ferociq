## Hey guys üëã

### üë§ About me

I'm Manu a freelance developer and enthusiastic gamer from germany. Currently building a network called [OPZebra](https://www.opzebra.de/)
My network "OPZebra" consists of many small projects. For example, we programmed one of the first global chat bots for Discord.  
I am currently working on some web stuff and I'm also starting a Discord for the fan community of the German children's book and radio play classic TKKG. 

If you are wondering why my personal account here is so empty, I mostly work on projects that are private.
I will publish the projects as soon as they are completely finished.
