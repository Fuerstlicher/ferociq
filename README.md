## Hey guys üëã

--------------------------------------------------

### üë§ About me

I'm Manu a freelance developer and enthusiastic gamer from germany. Currently building a network called [OPZebra](https://www.opzebra.de/).
My network consists of many small projects. For example, we programmed one of the first global chatbots for Discord in 2019, but it is now offline. 
Right now I'm focusing on our main project, which is the Bedwars guild on the Hypixel Minecraft network.

If you are wondering why my personal account here is so empty, I mostly work on projects that are private.
I will publish the projects as soon as they are completely finished.
